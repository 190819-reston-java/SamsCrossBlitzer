## User Story
As a proposed user of our Stock Investment and News application, I expect the ability to query a list of all the companies included in the SNP (Standard and Poorâ€™s) 500 list of stocks. Another expectation is for this application to provide a news feed regarding  general investment opportunities, including daily investment news which may impact the general Stock Market. Also, I would expect stock charts, and a forum which members can have discussions regarding investment strategies and the general economy. Finally , I would expect the ability to create an account ,simulated portfolios , and the ability for the tracking of these portfolios performance over time. The type of user of this application varies widely with users ranging from 18 - 80 years old. The user we expect to garner is anyone who is interested in investing and a community for the sharing of investment strategies.
